# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Introduction
Welcome to the introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this guide, we will explore key concepts in OOP that form the foundation of modern software development.

## Classes and Objects
In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and encapsulate both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Classes provide a way to structure and organize code.

## Access Modifiers
Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). They help define the level of encapsulation and protect the integrity of the class.

## Constructors
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created. They allow you to set initial values for object attributes and perform any necessary setup.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps hide the internal details of the class and exposes only what is necessary.

## Abstraction
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors. It allows developers to focus on relevant details and ignore unnecessary complexities.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (base class/parent class). It promotes code reuse and hierarchy.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables the use of a single interface to represent various types, promoting flexibility and extensibility.
